# Automatic Mitochondria Segmentation on Electron Microscopic Data

Studies have shown that there exists a relation between mitochondrial functions and degenerative disorders related to ageing, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Hence, there is a dire need for detailed and high-resolution analysis of physical alterations in mitochondria. Currently, the process is manual and laborious. Using U-Net based architectures, we have performed pixel based classification (semantic segmentation) to automatically segment mitochondria in the cells.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

We have used annotated [dataset](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-em/) from EPFL University, Switzerland. The 3D image represents a 5x5x5Âµm section taken from the CA1 hippocampus region of the brain, corresponding to a 1065x2048x1536 volume.

## Model <a name="model"></a>

[U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) is an U-shaped encoder-decoder convolution network architecture popularly used for semantic segmentation. It was developed by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer and Thomas Brox. We have trained both 2D and 3D unet architectures on the dataset and compared their performance. To evaluate these models, we have used dice coefficient metric.

## 2D U-Net <a name="2dunet"></a>

`unet.py` contains the implementation of 2D U-Net.

### Training & Evaluation<a name="2dtrain"></a>

The `2DUNet-mitochondria-segmentation-walkthrough.ipynb` contains the data preparation, training and evaluation of the 2D U-Net architecture. For training, we have croppped the subvolume to generate 256x256 2D slices. The model achieves a dice coefficient score of 0.87 with just 10 epochs.

### Training & Evaluation<a name="3dtrain"></a>

The `3DUNet-mitochondria-segmentation-walkthrough.ipynb` contains the data preparation, training and evaluation of the 3D U-Net architecture. For training, we have croppped the subvolume to generate voxels of size 64x64x64. The model achieves a dice coefficient score of 0.66 with ~50 epochs.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The 2D U-Net architecture performs better than 3D U-Net architecture with very less computation. However, it is possible that with large size voxels, 3D U-Net architecture might outperform the 2D U-Net architecture.
